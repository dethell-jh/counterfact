# Counterfact

Counterfact is a tool to help front end developers get ahead of the REST APIs on which they depend.

It reads an [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) document, then builds and runs a **TypeScript/Node** server which by default returns random, valid responses. You can then edit the TypeScript code in your IDE to add more realistic behavior. Unlike other, similar tools, Counterfact is **stateful and completely customizable**. Using the Swagger pet store as an example, you can `POST` a pet to `/pet` and `GET` that same pet via `/pet/{petId}` on the next request. It even supports _hot reloading on the server_, i.e. you can change behavior and see the difference immediately -- the server will see your code changes but won't drop the objects that were created on previous requests.

## Quick Start

Run this command to generate a server for the Swagger Pet Store. You can replace the URL below with a link or file path pointing to your own OpenAPI v3 document.

```sh
npx counterfact https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json api --open
```
