## High code, low effort, mock REST APIs

Having worked on several different teams at companies large and small, I found a consistent frustrating pattern:
**When I was working on frontend code, I spent more time fiddling with the backend so that I could test the frontend than I did building features and fixing bugs.** In order to move faster, I started creating lightweight mock services in Node that I could use in development. That of course meant maintaining two back ends -- the real one and the mocks -- trading one problem for another.

However, over the course of several years, I found ways to minimize the effort to create and maintain mocks. For example, if the APIs are documented with OpenAPI / Swagger (they should be!) we can use that documentation to automatically generate TypeScript code. Since a mock server doesn't need to scale or be secure, we can optimize everything around developer experience. These optimizations have culminated in **Counterfact, the fastest and easiest way to build and maintain mock REST APIs.**

<summary>What's wrong with the status quo?</summary>

- A typical web application these days spans multiple microservices, databases, etc. Standing up the whole stack locally takes a lot of effort (and defeats one of the main benefits of microservices).
- It's not uncommon for teams to run the front end locally and point to an API on a dev or QA server. Multiple developers working against the same backend with shared state is a recipe for disaster.
- Getting the back end in a state necessary to test functionality in the front end is tedious and time consuming, if not impossible.
- A mock server can help. But a mock server that returns random or predetermined responses can only get us so far. For testing multiple step workflows, sometimes we need a real server, or something that mimics the behavior of a real server. Ideally, we want something that mimics a real server except when we want it to behave in a controlled, predictable manner.
- From a customer's point of view, the frontend _is_ the app. If we can build the frontend without first having a backend in place, we can reduce cycle time and overproduction significantly.
- On some level, you got into software development because its _fun_. Don't you wish you could spend more time on the fun aspects of writing code and less time on tedious set up and testing?

## Usage

The only prerequisite is Node 16+.

### In a few seconds

<details open>
<summary>Turn an OpenAPI / Swagger spec into a mock server me</summary>

For example, run the following command to generate code for the [Swagger Petstore](https://petstore.swagger.io/).

```sh
  npx counterfact@latest https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.yaml api --open
```

That command generates and starts a TypeScript implementation of the Swagger Petstore which returns random, valid responses, outputting code to the "api" directory, and opens a web browser with tools to interact with the API. You can replace the Petstore URL with a link to your own spec, either a URL or a local file. OpenAPI / Swagger versions 2 and 3 are supported.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Generate TypeScript types</summary>

Again, using the [Swagger Petstore](https://petstore.swagger.io/) as an example:

```sh
  npx counterfact@latest https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.yaml api
```

Counterfact reads the components from the [spec](https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.yaml) and converts them into equivalent TypeScript types. For example, here's `./api/components/Pet.ts`:

```ts
import type { Category } from "./Category.js";
import type { Tag } from "./Tag.js";

export type Pet = {
  id?: number;
  name: string;
  category?: Category;
  photoUrls: Array<string>;
  tags?: Array<Tag>;
  status?: "available" | "pending" | "sold";
};
```

These types are used internally by Counterfact. You can also use them in your client-side code if you like.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Toggle between mocks and real services</summary>

Add the `--proxy-url <url>` flag to point to the location of a real server.

```sh
  npx counterfact@latest ./path/to/your/spec api --proxy-url https://your-server.example.com/
```

All requests will be proxied to the real server, e.g. a request to `http://localhost/hello-world` will be routed to `https://your-server.example.com/`. To toggle between having Counterfact handle requests and having it hand them off to the real server, type `.proxy on` / `.proxy off` in the REPL.

See the [usage guide](./docs/usage.md#proxy-peek-a-boo-) for more information.
