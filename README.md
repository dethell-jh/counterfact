Counterfact is (will be) a tool that helps front end developers and back end developers collaborate by quickly building reference implementations of [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) specs.

Counterfact is **not** for **production**.

Counterfact is **great** for **testing the UI**, both manual and automated testing. UI testing can be quite tedious and brittle in part because the _arrange_ part of Arrange, Act, Assert -- getting the server into a particular state -- is often slow, unpredictable, and complex. Counterfact bypasses the accidental complexity associated with arranging a real server's state, making tests that isolate the UI fast, repeatable, and easy to maintain.

It accomplishes that without over-isolating. You can run a full scenario: log in, make changes, log in with a different user, and see the effects of those changes. The server you're testing against is a _real_ server from the UI's perspective: it implements business logic and maintains state. It's only not real in the sense that it doesn't have to support 10,000 concurrent users, protect real data, go through a deployment pipeline, or maintain 99.99% uptime.

Counterfact is **great** for **communication between front end and back end teams**. OpenAPI does an excellent job defining the inputs and outputs of a RESTful service, but it can't tell us how a server is supposed to behave. Counterfact fills that gap. The feedback cycle is orders of magnitude faster than making changes to a real, scalable back end and then seeing how those changes affect the UI/UX.

## Road to 1.0

This project is a work in progress. As of July 15, 2022, most of the plumbing is in place. This project will reach 1.0 when mutation test coverage is > 90% and:

The following command

```sh
npx counterfact init ./my-petstore https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.yaml
```

creates or augments an npm package, and after changing to the directory

```sh
cd my-petstore
```

the following command

```
yarn start
```

opens a browser with Swagger-UI pointing to a server that implements the pet store API.

Not a mock server that returns canned or randomly generated responses, a [_real_ implementation](./demo-ts/), written in TypeScript.

Or at least, the _potential_ for a real implementation. Out of the box, it will return example or random responses. But the code is easy to edit so, e.g., we can change `PUT /pet` to store a `Pet` in memory / a database / a microservice / etc., and `GET /pet` to retrieve that same `Pet`.

We can see the effects of the code changes _without restarting the server_.

And then after running

```sh
npm run counterfact generate /path/to/copy/of/petstore/with/some/changes.yaml
```

it regenerates the code except for the files that we changed. Of the files we changed, the IDE (via TypeScript and ESLint) tells us if the code needs to be modified to conform to the updated spec.

_Again, without restarting the server._

## Beyond 1.0

The scenario above describes a zero-configuration happy path, adhering to the philosophy of convention over configuration.

The next phase is to add configuration options that define things like what port the server runs on, when generated files are overwritten, where those files live, whether to add `start` and `generate` scripts and what they should be named, whether to build a soup-to-nuts server or only make Express / Koa / Connect middleware available, etc. These configurations may be set in a `.counterfactrc.json` file, environment variables, and or command line options, whatever makes sense.

(By the way, generating code is optional. When this project started, that wasn't even part of the scope. If you don't have an OpenAPI spec, or don't want to use it, Counterfact is still an ergonomic platform on which to build quick and dirty prototypes of RESTful services in TypeScript or JavaScript.)

After that, more features that improve developer experience. For example, say you're demoing an iOS music player app and someone asks about edge cases. You'll be able answer questions immediately by going into a REPL and typing things like:

```ts
context.addABunchOfSongsToCatalog(1_000_000);

context.setAlbumTitle(
  123,
  "This Is is a Very Long Name That is Definitely Not Going to Fit in the Allotted Space and it has Emoji ðŸ¦§"
);

network.setLatency("1-5s");
```

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev counterfact
```

or

```sh
yarn add -D counterfact
```

## Usage

See [./docs/usage.md](./docs/usage.md)

## Development Setup

Looking to get involved? You can begin by cloning the project and using one of the following setup options.

### Installation (devcontainer)

> **BETA**: We are working through using a devcontainer for development. If you have [Docker](https://docker.com) on your machine and would like to give it a go and give us some feedback, please clone the repo, and then follow the instructions on the following page in place of the Installation instructions below.
>
> - [Quick start: Open an existing folder in a container.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_quick-start-open-an-existing-folder-in-a-container)

### Installation (Original Method)

Installation will set up Git hooks and install all of the Node packages.

1. Make sure you have [Node 16](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
2. Install yarn by running `npm install -g yarn`.
3. Install the dependencies by running `yarn install`.
