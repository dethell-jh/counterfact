high code, low effort mock REST APIs
Are you mocking me?
stop, mock, and roll
fake it till you make it
things are about to get real
when opportunity mocks
your time is very important to us
This is an HTTP joke. GET it?
the REPL alliance 
there is no spoon
what you say is what you get
pay no attention to man behind the curtain
at your service
I'm afraid I can do that, Dave
Hey! I'm mockin' here!
all mock no friction
a cubic zirconia in the rough
maybe she’s born with it…
made on an Apple in Carolina
a Three Kids in a Trench Coat production 
a little sleight of &&
there’s no place like localhost
my favorite book is Charlatan’s Web
fact follows fiction
your lovely assistant
my other server’s a Kubernetes cluster 
you wrote it here first
here lies “waiting on back-end”; REST in peace
your front-end’s REST friend
first past the post
🎶 mockin' the casbah 🎶
you ready to mock and roll?
I also do weddings and bar mocks-vahs
I’m thinking about going into fake estate
I bet you’re real fun at mocktail parties
Eat. Sleep. Mock. Repeat.
hand over the cache and no one gets hurt
Storybook for the back-end
you are now free to mock about the cabin
close enough for government work
an API in hand is worth two in the cloud
where we're going, we don't need wifi
paper prototyping the back-end
the cloud natives are restless
your front-end dev flight simulator
your front-end’s sparring partner
your back-end's stunt double
